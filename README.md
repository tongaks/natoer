i'm not really sure what to do. 
there's lot of things i want to learn and create,
i want to learn 3d printing
i want to learn more about cybersec
i want to create useful apps

but in the end, im not finishing it all
or just suddenly stop doing it.

i want to be content, yet 
i want to have everything i want
but everything comes with responsibility.
am i really going to use it?
am i really going to commit to it?
or is it going to end up in another 'to do list'?

though its nice having and experiencing those,
i kinda just want to lay in my bed and slowly rot away.
